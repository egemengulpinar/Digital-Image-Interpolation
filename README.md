# Digital-Image-Interpolation
In this project, I used zero order hold, first order hold, KNN and Bilinear Interpolation algorithms for Image Interpolation. As a result of this, I have shown in my GUI program for an input: zoom in-out with these algorithms and calculated process time for Bresenham line algorithm, DDA line algorithm, grayscale and rotate input image.
