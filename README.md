# Digital-Image-Interpolation
In this project, I used zero order hold, first order hold,
KNN and Bilinear interpolation algorithms for image interpolation.
As a result of this, I have shown in my GUI program for an input:
zoom in-out with these algorithms and calculated process time for Bresenham line algorithm,
DDA line algorithm, grayscale and rotate input image.

## Interpolation Algorithms Used

1. Pixel Replication
    - Zero-Order Hold
    - First-Order Hold
    - Nearest Neighbor Interpolation
2. K-Times Zooming
3. Bilinear Interpolation

## Using & Run 

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/egemengulpinar/Digital-Image-Interpolation.git
```

Open `Visual Studio` and import the project directory.

Select `graphicProje` file in Visual Studio and execute the program.

 When you execute the program, you should select any **small** size image.
 You can fit the input image for show all details in imageBox.
You can also do:
  
  - Rotate image 90, 180, 270
  - Draw Bresenham Line and DDA Line Algorithms and show their process time
  - Zoom in-out with Zero-Hold, First-Hold, K-Times & Bilinear 
  - Fit & Original Image
